# Observations

I thought it was very interesting that the duration of the unstressed
‘o’, 147.061, was almost half of that of the stressed ‘o’, 239.573. The
intensity for the two o’s seemed to be pretty similar (66.1266 versus
68.4125). Lasltly, the duration of the stressed ‘hablo’, 616.045, was
longer than that of the unstressed ‘hablo’, 479.146. This actually made
me wonder if perhaps I produced the stressed word more carefully than
the unstressed one. (But I re-recorded the sound and it was quite
similar.)
